# Milligrids
11hp version of Grids (topographic drum sequencer eurorack module) by Mutable Instruments

# NOTICE
IF YOU BUILD THIS DO NOT BOTHER OLIVIER GILLET, MUTABLE INSTRUMENTS or THE MUTABLE INSTRUMENTS FORUM WITH QUESTIONS! JUST DON'T! 

I might help you. But my priorities are in this order: my kids, my spouse, my job, my jobby, my mental health, looking out of the window, finishing my pile of synth related pcbs, watching videos on Youtube about country borders, manufacturing processes and cyclists from the 80s and 90s, and finally, somewhere close to the end of this list: helping you when you're failing at programming a Milligrids or needing help finding alternatives for parts in the BOM. ;)
